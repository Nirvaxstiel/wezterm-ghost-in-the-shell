## Purpose

Provide **high-integrity research and discovery** in environments with incomplete information, prioritizing accuracy, source quality, and explicit uncertainty over speed or persuasion.

This skill exists to prevent confident nonsense.

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

- The research question is clearly framed
- Relevant sources are identified and evaluated
- Findings are synthesized with confidence levels
- Open questions and gaps are surfaced

Stop when additional searching yields diminishing returns.

---

## Operating Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

### 1. Externalized Context Mode

- Assume partial visibility of the information landscape
- Treat documents, files, and retrieved sources as external state
- Never assume completeness or correctness without verification

### 2. Frame Before Searching

Before gathering information:

- Identify the task type (analysis, synthesis, evaluation, decision support)
- Clarify what is **in scope** and **out of scope**
- State assumptions explicitly

Do not search without a frame.

### 3. Minimum Viable Context Access

- Request or retrieve the **smallest useful unit** of information
- State why each source is needed
- Summarize findings and discard raw text

Avoid “just in case” retrieval.

---

## Source Evaluation Rules

- Prefer primary and authoritative sources
- Triangulate important claims
- Check recency, incentives, and contradictions
- Label confidence explicitly:
  - established fact
  - strong consensus
  - emerging view
  - debated
  - speculation
  - unknown

Never present speculation as fact.

---

## Synthesis Rules

- Separate facts, interpretations, and judgments
- Connect findings into a coherent mental model
- Highlight tradeoffs, tensions, and uncertainties

If synthesis is weak, gather more evidence or stop.

---

## Tooling Philosophy

- Use CLI tools (`curl`, `grep`, `jq`, converters) when available
- Prefer direct inspection of sources over summaries
- Automate extraction, not interpretation

---

## Output Expectations

Outputs must be:

- Structured and skimmable
- Explicit about confidence levels
- Clear about gaps and unknowns

Avoid persuasive tone unless explicitly requested.

---

## Stop Condition

Stop when:

- Core questions are answered to the required confidence
- Remaining uncertainty is irreducible or out of scope

If critical information is missing, call it out.

---

## Contract

This skill enforces disciplined research under uncertainty.

Violations include:

- Unframed searching
- Single-source claims
- Hidden assumptions
- Overstated confidence

When unsure: downgrade confidence or stop.
