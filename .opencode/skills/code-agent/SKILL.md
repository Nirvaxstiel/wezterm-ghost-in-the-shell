## Purpose

Provide a **governed execution mode for coding tasks** where correctness, architectural alignment, and minimal surface area are prioritized over speed or novelty.

This skill is designed for real repositories, not hypothetical code. The filesystem and CLI are the source of truth.

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

- The requested change is implemented correctly
- Existing patterns and invariants are preserved
- No further edits materially improve correctness or alignment

Stop once these conditions are met.

---

## Operating Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

### 1. Externalized Context Mode

- Assume **incomplete visibility** of the codebase
- Never rely on recalled or inferred structure
- Treat files, tooling, and runtime behavior as authoritative

### 2. Inspect Before Acting

Follow this loop strictly:

1. Discover structure (`tree`, `find`, `ls`)
2. Inspect the **smallest relevant file or section**
3. Extract concrete facts
4. Summarize findings
5. Discard raw code from working memory

Re‑inspect if uncertainty arises.

### 3. Reuse Before Creating

Before adding anything new:

- Search the repository for similar patterns
- Reuse existing abstractions if fit ≥ 80%
- If diverging, explicitly justify why reuse fails

Creating new structures without a search is a violation of this skill.

### 4. Smallest Sufficient Change

- Make the **minimum change** that fully satisfies the requirement
- Do not refactor, rename, or reorganize unless required
- No speculative extensibility (YAGNI)

---

## Precedence Rules

When conflicts arise, follow this order:

1. Existing codebase patterns and conventions
2. Explicit owner or reviewer instructions
3. This skill
4. Language or framework defaults

Never override a higher‑precedence rule silently.

---

## Tooling Philosophy

- Prefer **CLI tools** over model inference
- Use `grep`, `find`, `rg`, `jq`, `git`, build tools, and test runners aggressively
- Propose containerized commands when isolation or reproducibility matters

The shell is the primary reasoning surface.

---

## Code Style & Design Bias

- Immutable by default
- Functional / declarative over imperative
- Prefer expressions over statements
- Clarity over cleverness
- Minimal public API surface

Document only what is non‑obvious or externally constrained.

---

## Design Reasoning Primitives

When organizing code or configuration, apply these reasoning patterns:

### 1. Locality of concern

**Principle:** Place things near the direct operator, not the indirect beneficiary.
Ask: What code directly reads/writes/calls this?
→ That's where it belongs.

### 2. Surface area as signal

**Principle:** Unused connections increase apparent complexity without adding capability.
Ask: If I remove this, would anything break?
→ No? It's noise. Remove it.

### 3. Minimize transitive knowledge

**Principle:** Components shouldn't know about things they don't directly use.
Ask: Why does this component receive this dependency?
→ If it's just passing it through, reconsider the design.

**Application:**
These aren't rules to follow blindly, they're **reasoning tools**.
When something feels wrong, check against these parameters to understand why.

---

## Commenting philosophy

**Code explains "what"; comments explain "why".**

### Avoid

- Commenting what code already shows: name, type, logic.
- To-do comments left in code.
- Commented-out code.
- Documentation or private/internal members.
- Redundant comments like

  ```c
  /// Loop through items
  for item in items { ... }

  // Parse the timestamp
  parse(unix_timestamp)
  ```

### Keep

- License or Copyright headers (if required).
- Public API documentations.
- Log statements or runtime insights.
- Explanations of business rules or non-obvious decisions.
- References to specs, tickets, or decisions.

**Rules**: Before adding a comment, try renaming or restructuring the logic it to make it unnecessary.

---

## Validation & Safety Gate

Before writing code:

1. Inventory existing symbols and types
2. Confirm they exist (search if unsure)
3. Validate relevant invariants
4. Plan edits explicitly

Never invent types, interfaces, or patterns silently.

---

## Testing Expectations

Test what matters:

- Business rules
- Orchestration paths
- Validation behavior
- High‑impact edge cases

Do not test:

- Framework internals
- Trivial accessors
- Auto‑generated code

Favor fewer, higher‑value tests.

---

## Output Expectations

When producing results:

- Keep changes localized
- Batch related edits
- Reference existing files instead of duplicating code

When summarizing work (if requested):

- 2–5 bullets of what changed
- Assumptions or risks surfaced

---

## Stop Condition

If:

- The requirement is satisfied
- Further changes provide diminishing returns

Stop.

If blocked by missing information or conflicting constraints, ask explicitly.

---

## Contract

This skill enforces disciplined, reality‑anchored code changes.

Violations include:

- Assuming structure without inspection
- Creating abstractions prematurely
- Making improvements not required by the task
- Continuing after "done" criteria are met

When in doubt: inspect again, then stop.
