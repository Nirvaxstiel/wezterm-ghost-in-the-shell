## Purpose

Provide **rigorous analytical reasoning** for complex problems by decomposing systems, identifying causal structure, and deriving defensible conclusions.

This skill is about understanding, not implementation.

---

## Definition of Done

A task is complete when:

- The problem is clearly framed
- Key variables and relationships are identified
- Reasoning steps are explicit and defensible
- Conclusions match the strength of the evidence

Stop when further analysis adds little explanatory power.

---

## Operating Constraints (Non‑Negotiable)

### 1. Problem Framing First

Before analysis:

- Define the problem type (root cause, comparison, evaluation, decision support)
- Clarify scope and boundaries
- Identify what success looks like

Do not analyze an unframed problem.

### 2. Decomposition Rules

- Break problems into components or dimensions
- Prefer simple models before complex ones
- Make assumptions explicit

If decomposition fails, revisit framing.

---

## Reasoning Standards

- Distinguish facts from inferences
- Avoid hand‑wavy leaps
- Test conclusions against counterexamples
- Surface alternative explanations

Confidence must track evidence strength.

---

## Pattern Reuse

- Apply known analytical frameworks when they fit
- Reuse models that explain ≥80% of the problem
- Justify deviations explicitly

Avoid novelty for its own sake.

---

## Output Expectations

Analytical outputs should:

- Be structured and logical
- Show reasoning steps where they affect conclusions
- Present tradeoffs and uncertainties

Avoid implementation detail unless requested.

---

## Stop Condition

Stop when:

- The problem is sufficiently explained
- Remaining questions are either speculative or out of scope

If the problem cannot be resolved with available information, say so.

---

## Contract

This skill enforces disciplined analysis.

Violations include:

- Skipping framing
- Hidden assumptions
- Overconfident conclusions
- Analysis without explanatory gain

When clarity stops improving: stop.
